		This section contains overview of several demos provided as introduction 
		to <b>Components</b> module.
	</sdk:entry>
	<sdk:subsubtitle>
		CompTest01
	</sdk:subsubtitle>	
	<sdk:entry>			
		This is so called "Hello World" example of using shared components
		(from the point of view of local client). Single call to 
		"Components::InstantiateCommon" is required to instantiate any object 
		located in shared library by passing unique identifier (mc::clsid).
		The goal of this demo is focusing on the transparency of libraries 
		load and unload mechanizms from client-side code.

		CompTest02
	</sdk:subsubtitle>	
	<sdk:entry>			
		This demo extends CompTest1 to demonstrate both containment model
		embedded into the library and events dispatching mechanizms 
		(with trivial support for ecent cancellation).

	<sdk:image path="images/ct02_001.wmf" descr="CompTest02 schema"/>
	<sdk:entry>			
		The following schema demonstrates event spreading after invocation of 
		internal object's method:

	<sdk:subsubtitle>
		CompTest03
	</sdk:subsubtitle>	
	<sdk:entry>		
		CompTest03 demonstrates client-side interaction with object supporting 
		undo/redo mechanism. 
	</sdk:entry>		
	<sdk:subtitle>
		Notes
	</sdk:subtitle>	
	<sdk:entry>		
		CompTest0X is a set of client-side demonstrations. You are to acquaint 
		yourself with the source code of "AreasLib" project to become familiar 
		with implementing objects' hierarchies based on containment with
		embedded dispatching and undo support. 		
	</sdk:entry>	
	<sdk:entry>		
		To execute and debug examples from within Visual Studio environment 
		you must explicitly set "Working Directory" property
		(Configuration Properties->Debugging->Working Directory) to:
		"../../../bin/vs2005/$(ConfigurationName)" (without quotes).
		It is necessary to do because since MSVS 2005 this property has been 
		moved outside of ".vcproj" to ".user" file. Files of the last type 
		are not included into repository for security reasons.
