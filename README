CommonKit version 0.1.0
Released Monday, ?? ?? 2009.

Cross-platform component-based C++ software development framework providing 
 - smart pointers support for both internal and external reference counting schemas (based on Loki library), 
 - events dispatching, 
 - undo/redo automation, 
 - concurrency mechanisms, 
 - transparent support for scalability (smart shared objects loader), 
 - high-level network interaction (based on boost::asio) and 
 - support for distributed systems design and implementation ("Remoting" component).
	
The mainstream of CommonKit project development is an idea that it is possible to create portable, 
fast and reliable programs in C++ with no extra time or human resource expenses. It means that besides 
implementation of most commonly applied mechanisms this core software package provides the way for creating 
lightweight and (I have to repeat it one more time) fast and reliable source code. 	

Supported platforms:
 - Win32.

Dependencies:
 - Boost libraries. You have to download Boost (http://www.boost.org/) and configure your IDE and projects to
   point to correct location of Boost source code. Note that you do not need to build Boost from its source code. 
   CommonKit bases only on header libraries from Boost package.  
- Loki library.
  
Package content:
 - CommonKit source code. 
 - Loki 0.1.6 (last update: Novmber 16, 2005).
